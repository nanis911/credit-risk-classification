# Credit Risk Classification
## Overview
This project aims to assess the creditworthiness of borrowers using a logistic regression model. By analyzing historical lending data from a peer-to-peer lending company, the model predicts whether a loan is likely to default (high-risk) or remain healthy. The purpose is to assist financial institutions in making informed lending decisions.

## Results
The logistic regression model was evaluated using a confusion matrix, accuracy score, and classification report. Below are the key results:

Confusion Matrix:

- True Negatives (Correctly predicted healthy loans): 18,655
- False Positives (Healthy loans misclassified as high-risk): 110
- False Negatives (High-risk loans misclassified as healthy): 36
- True Positives (Correctly predicted high-risk loans): 583
